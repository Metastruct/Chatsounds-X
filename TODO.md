# TODO:

- LfoPitch kills the audio output for the process its running in (under Windows at least)
- LegacyPitch, need to figure out a way to transition between one pitch to another smoothly
- Combining other modifiers with the repeat modifier breaks it
- Test Cutoff, skip and duration modifiers
- WebRTC to node.js "library" so we can stream the audio back to our clients
